# Data Frames 
# Data frames are used to store tabular data in R. 
package dplyr35 has an optimized set of functions designed to work efficiently with data frames. 
every element of the list has to have the same length. 

#Data frames can store different classes of objects in each column. 

#Data frames are usually created by reading in a dataset using the read.table() or read.csv(). 
>x <- data.frame(foo = 1:4, bar = c(T, T, F, F)) 
>x 

foo bar 
1 1 TRUE 2 2 TRUE 
	.	3  3 FALSE 
	.	4  4 FALSE 
> nrow(x)
[1] 4
> ncol(x)
[1] 2

# Names 
useful for writing readable code and self-describing objects. 
> x <- 1:3
> names(x)
NULL

> names(x) <- c("New York", "Seattle", "Los Angeles") 
>x 

New York     Seattle Los Angeles
