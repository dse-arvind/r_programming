#Reproducible Research Checklist

• Checklist
– Are we doing good science?
– Was any part of this analysis done by hand?
∗ If so, are those parts precisely document?
∗ Does the documentation match reality?
– Have we taught a computer to do as much as possible (i.e. coded)?
– Are we using a version control system?
– Have we documented our software environment?
– Have we saved any output that we cannot reconstruct from original data + code?
– How far back in the analysis pipeline can we go before our results are no longer (automatically)
reproducible?

#Do’s
• start with good science
– work on interesting problem (to you & other people)
– form coherent/focused question to simplify problem
– collaborate with others to reinforce good practices and habits
• teach a computer
• use version control
 helps to keep track of history/snapshots – allows reverting to old versions
• keep track of software environment
– some tools/datasets may only work on certain software/environment


Don’ts
• do things by hand
– downloading data from website (clicking on link)
∗ need lengthy set of instructions to obtain the same data set
• point and click
