R Markdown
• integration of R code and markdown

# pros
∗ text/code all in one place in logical order 11
url "text"
∗ data/results automatically updated to reflect external changes
∗ code is live = automatic test when building document

#cons
∗ text/code all in one place, can be difficult to read especially if there’s a lot of code ∗ can substantially slowdown processing of documents
