#ggplot2 Plotting System

• library(ggplot2) = loads ggplot2 package
• implementation of Grammar of Graphics by Leland Wilkinson, written by Hadley Wickham (created
RStudio)

“In brief, the grammar tells us that a statistical graphic is a mapping from data to aesthetic attributes (color, shape, size) of geometric objects (points, lines, bars). The plot may also contain statistical transformations of the data and is drawn on a specific coordinate system”

• grammar graphics plot, splits the different between base and lattice systems
• automatically sets spacings/text/tiles but also allows annotations to be added
• default makes a lot of choices, but still customizable


#ggplot2 Functions and Parameters
• basic components of a ggplot2 graphic
– data frame = source of data
– aesthetic mappings = how data are mappped to color/size (x vs y) – geoms = geometric objects like points/lines/shapes to put on page
– facets = conditional plots using factor variables/multiple panels
– stats = statistical transformations like binning/quantiles/smoothing – scales = scale aesthetic map uses (i.e. male = red, female = blue)
– coordinate system = system in which data are plotted


#• qplot(x, y, data , color, geom) = quick plot, analogous to base system’s plot() function
– default style: gray background, white gridlines, x and y labels automatic, and solid black circles for data points
– data always comes from data frame (in unspecified, function will look for data in workspace)
– plots are made up of aesthetics (size, shape, color) and geoms (points, lines)
#
• factor variables: important for graphing subsets of data = they should be labelled with specific information, and not just 1, 2, 3
– color = factor1 = use the factor variable to display subsets of data in different colors on the same plot (legend automatically generated)
– shape = factor2 = use the factor variable to display subsets of data in different shapes on the same plot (legend automatically generated)
– example
 library(ggplot2)
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, color = drv, shape = drv)
